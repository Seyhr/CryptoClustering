# CryptoClustering

The goal of this Project is to create Composite plot to contrast the Elbow curve.
First we will find the best value of K using the scaled Dataframe and create a scatter plot with x-axis as "price_change_percentage_24h" and the y-axis as "price_change_percentage_7d.
Secondly we will find the best K value  Using the PCA DataFrame and create the Create a scatter plot with the x-axis as "PC1" and the y-axis as "PC2".

Next step is to create Composite plot to contrast the Elbow curves
